# Documentation Directory

This directory contains project documentation generated throughout the workshop modules.

## Files

- Backend structure (Express, TypeScript, PostgreSQL)
- Frontend structure (React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Configuration files (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- Validation criteria

**Created in:** Module 1 (Scaffold generation)

---

### MODULE2_CRUD_PRD.md
Product Requirements Document for CRUD operations. Specifies:
- Database schema for tasks table
- Task model with CRUD functions
- Task controller and routes
- Frontend task components (TaskList, TaskForm)
- Validation checklist

**Created in:** Module 2 (CRUD implementation)

### PERFORMANCE_OPTIMIZATIONS.md
Documentation of performance improvements including:
- Database query optimizations
- Index additions
- N+1 query elimination
- Code duplication reduction
- Response time improvements

## Documentation Standards

All documentation follows these principles:
1. **Clear structure** - Organized with headers and sections
2. **Code examples** - Include request/response samples
3. **Completeness** - Cover all features and edge cases
4. **Currency** - Updated as features change
5. **Accessibility** - Written for various skill levels

## Using Documentation

### For Development
- Reference API_DOCUMENTATION.md when building integrations
- Check PRDs for feature requirements and validation criteria
- Review optimization docs before making performance changes

### For Testing
- Use API docs to verify endpoint behavior
- Reference PRDs for test case coverage
- Validate optimizations against documented benchmarks

### For Onboarding
- Start with SCAFFOLD_PRD to understand project structure
- Read API_DOCUMENTATION for backend integration
- Review optimization docs for best practices

## Maintenance

Documentation should be updated when:
- New endpoints are added
- API contracts change
- Performance optimizations are applied
- Feature requirements evolve

Use Documentation Subagent to maintain docs:
```
Documentation Subagent: Update API_DOCUMENTATION.md with new /api/notifications endpoint
```
