# Team Task Manager - Cursor IDE Workshop

This project demonstrates progressive Cursor IDE feature adoption through building a production-ready task management application.

## Cursor Features Demonstrated

### 1. Cursor Rules (.cursor/rules/*.mdc)
**Purpose:** Define coding standards and patterns that apply automatically during code generation.

**Files:**
- `typescript-react-vite.mdc` - Frontend TypeScript/React/Vite standards
- `nodejs-express-jwt-api.mdc` - Backend API patterns with JWT auth
- `tailwind-react-ui.mdc` - UI/UX best practices with Tailwind
- `team-task-manager-patterns.mdc` - Project-specific patterns

**Impact:** Ensures consistent code style, security practices, and architectural patterns across the entire codebase.

---

### 2. Cursor Skills (.cursor/skills/*.md)
**Purpose:** Executable multi-step workflows with human-in-the-loop (HITL) checkpoints for complex features.

**Files:**
- `add-auth-feature.md` - Complete JWT authentication implementation workflow

**Impact:** Guided implementation of complex features with validation checkpoints, preventing compounding errors.

---

### 3. Memory Bank (memory_bank/*.md)
**Purpose:** Living project documentation that provides persistent context to AI across sessions.

**Files:**
- `memory_bank_projectbrief.md` - Project requirements and goals
- `mmemory_bank_productContext.md` - Problem space and user needs
- `mmemory_bank_techContext.md` - Technology stack and decisions
- `mmemory_bank_systemPatterns.md` - Architecture and design patterns
- `mmemory_bank_activeContext.md` - Current development state
- `mmemory_bank_progress.md` - Status tracking and known issues

**Impact:** AI makes informed decisions aligned with project architecture and goals, reducing need to re-explain context.

---

### 4. Subagents (parallel AI agents)
**Purpose:** Deploy specialized AI agents for parallel work on testing, documentation, and refactoring.

**Used for:**
- Testing Subagent → Generated comprehensive test suites (80%+ coverage)
- Documentation Subagent → Created API docs and guides
- Refactor Subagent → Optimized queries and reduced code duplication

**Impact:** 3-4x faster development through parallelization of specialized tasks.

---

### 5. Documentation Indexing (@docs)
**Purpose:** Reference external framework documentation for accurate, up-to-date code generation.

**Indexed Docs:**
- React official documentation
- Express.js documentation
- PostgreSQL documentation

**Impact:** Real-time WebSocket implementation using current best practices from official docs.

---

### 6. MCP (Model Context Protocol)
**Purpose:** Extend AI capabilities with external tools for browser automation and testing.

**MCP Server Used:**
- Playwright MCP → Browser automation for E2E testing

**Impact:** AI-generated E2E tests that actually run in real browsers with screenshots and validation.

## Progressive Development Timeline

```
Module 1: Rules → Project scaffold with coding standards
Module 2: Rules + Composer → Task CRUD operations
Module 3: Skills → JWT authentication system
Module 4: Memory Bank → Team collaboration features
Module 5: Subagents → Tests, docs, and optimizations
Module 6: Doc Indexing → Real-time WebSocket features
Module 7: MCP Playwright → E2E test automation
```

## Development Time Comparison

**Traditional Approach:** ~40-60 hours
**With Cursor Features:** ~8-12 hours (75-80% time savings)

## Key Learnings

1. **Rules** are passive - they apply automatically to maintain consistency
2. **Skills** are active - you invoke them for complex multi-step workflows
3. **Memory Bank** provides intelligence - AI remembers project context
4. **Subagents** enable parallelization - multiple tasks simultaneously
5. **Doc Indexing** ensures accuracy - current framework best practices
6. **MCP** extends capabilities - real tool integration (browsers, databases, cloud services)

## Feature Usage Guidelines

| When to Use | Feature | Example |
|-------------|---------|---------|
| **Always** | Rules | Every file follows coding standards |
| **Complex features** | Skills | Authentication, payments, file uploads |
| **New sessions** | Memory Bank | AI understands project without re-explaining |
| **Specialized tasks** | Subagents | Testing while building features |
| **Framework-specific** | Doc Indexing | Using latest React hooks patterns |
| **Tool integration** | MCP | Browser testing, database ops, cloud resources |
